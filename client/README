| This directory contains all of the files necessary to compile and execute the Vault client. |
| The client has a CLI, go to ../client_web to locate the GUI.                                |
|                                                                                             |
| To compile the program execute `make` in this directory.                                    |

|                                                                                                                        |
| To execute initial configuration:                                                                                      |
| 	$ vault --config                                                                                                 |

|	This will prompt you for a username, a password, and the global user key.                                        |
|	Initial config will be performed automatically before any storage commands on first-time usage.                  |
|                                                                                                                        |
| To store a file:                                                                                                       |
|	$ vault --rstore <localfile> <remotefile>                                                                        |

|	This will store the local file <localfile> at the remote location <remotefile>.                                  |
|                                                                                                                        |

|	This is the same as --rstore, except <remotefile> is assumed to be equal to <localfile>.                         |
|                                                                                                                        |

|                                                                                                                        |
|	This is the same as --rstore and --store, except another layer of symmetric-key protection is added to the file. |
|                                                                                                                        |
|	$ vault --rget <remotefile> <localfile>                                                                          |
|                                                                                                                        |
|	This will retrieve the file located at <remotefile> to <localfile>.                                              |
|                                                                                                                        |
|	$ vault --get <remotefile>                                                                                       |
|                                                                                                                        |
|	This is the same as --rget, except <remotefile> is assumed to be equal to <localfile>.                           |
|                                                                                                                        |
|	$ vault --enc <password> --rget <remotefile> <localfile>                                                         |
|	$ vault --enc <password> --rget <remotefile>                                                                     |
|                                                                                                                        |
|	This is the same as --rget and --get, except a second layer of encryption is decrypted using the password.       |
