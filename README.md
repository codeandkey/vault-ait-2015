This is an archived project from 2015 for the Applied Cryptography course at the Aquincum Institute of Technology.

It is WILDLY unsafe to use (see the 'minor' note in syscall.c) as the source code was written by a much younger Justin :) I am archiving it as it is one of my first projects in cryptography.
